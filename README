This plugin enables RabbitMQ to perform authentication (determining who can log in) and 
authorisation (determining what permissions they have) by connecting to a postgresql database.
   Right now, only the authentication part is implemented. The authorisation is in progress. 

Note: it's at an early stage of development, and could be made rather more robust.
